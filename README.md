PS: ci_df is meaning cognify internship dataframe.

MY DATA SCIENCE PROJECT AT COGNIFYZ INTERNSHIP LEVEL 1 (FIRST TASK)
In the level one of my internship, my first task would be :
- Explore the dataset and identify the number of rows and columns.
- Check for missing values in each column and handle them accordingly.
- Perform data type conversion if necessary.
- Analyze the distribution of the target variable ("Aggregate rating") and identify any class imbalances.


My second task will be:
- Descriptive Analysis
- Calculate basic statistical measures (mean,median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical columns.
- Explore the distribution of categorical variables like "Country Code","City", and "Cuisines".
- Identify the top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.

My third task will be:
- Visualize the locations of restaurants on a map using latitude and longitude information.
- Analyze the distribution of restaurants across different cities or countries.
- Determine if there is any correlation between the restaurant's location and its rating.


MY DATA SCIENCE PROJECT AT COGNIFYZ INTERNSHIP LEVEL 2 (FIRST TASK)
In the level two of my internship, my first task would be :

- To Determine the percentage of restaurants that offer table booking and online delivery.
- To Compare the average ratings of restaurants with table booking and those without.
- Analyze the availability of online delivery among restaurants with different price ranges.

My Second Task will be:
- To Determine the most common price range among all the restaurants.
- To Calculate the average rating for each price range.


My Third Task will be:
- Extract additional features from the existing columns, such as the length of the restaurant name or address.
- Create new features like "Has Table Booking" or "Has Online Delivery" by encoding categorical variables.

MY DATA SCIENCE PROJECT AT COGNIFYZ INTERNSHIP LEVEL 3 
- Build a regression model to predict the aggregate rating of a restaurant based on available features.
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets and evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
- Experiment with different algorithms (e.g.,linear regression, decision trees, random forest) and compare their performance.
