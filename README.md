MY DATA SCIENCE PROJECT AT COGNIFYZ INTERNSHIP LEVEL 1 (FIRST TASK)
In the level one of my internship, my first task would be :
- Explore the dataset and identify the number of rows and columns.
- Check for missing values in each column and handle them accordingly.
- Perform data type conversion if necessary.
- Analyze the distribution of the target variable ("Aggregate rating") and identify any class imbalances.


My second task will be:
- Descriptive Analysis
- Calculate basic statistical measures (mean,median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical columns.
- Explore the distribution of categorical variables like "Country Code","City", and "Cuisines".
- Identify the top cuisines and cities with the highest number of restaurants.
